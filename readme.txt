VGMCMP by Freddy VETELE

First Release of my .VGM File compressor.

This tool put a minimal delay of 8.3ms (120Hz) between commands and optimize the commands sent to the CMS Ship.
It can reduce the file size Up to 10x, with no compression.

It Does not support the .VGZ files, uncompress them before.

Of course, it can't be used for .VGM using Digital audio.
Then, it is for "Analog" Audio chip only.

It can search and convert files in batch, like "VCMCMP *.VGM"
The compressed file will replace the origianl file and the original file is renamed with the .OLD extention.

To be used under MS DOS as it is coded in Turbo Pascal.
